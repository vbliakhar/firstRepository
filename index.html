				<p>
					In the current post-truth era, it is crucially important to provide everyone with a free access to a primary source of information whatever data is concerned. A basic right to know the actual quality conditions of the air we breathe is a must. Not only scientific organizations and huge corporations but every single earthling is to be able to monitor and control the quality of air at home, in office, throughout the city or elsewhere.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
					The AI-powered predictive analytics is what can deliver unbiased recommendations and precise forecasts regarding the measures capable of improving air quality conditions in our overpopulated urban areas. If obsolete industrial technologies cause the biggest air pollution, the contemporary digital technologies should help fix the situation and mitigate the climate change.

					Technology
				</h2>
				<p>	
						The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment.
					</p>
					</br>
				<p>	
			Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.
